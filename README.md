## Introduction

For this project we were asked to create a team profile generator using Node.js command-line prompts. After users fill out all of the prompts an HTML is produced that displays employee information in seperate cards. We were also asked to test our application with Jest. 

## User Interaction Criteria

Users will need to install Node and Inquirer to use this application. By prompting "npm i" in the integrated terminal these tools will automatically download. After installation, users need to trigger the prompts by typing "node index.js".

## Tech

Node.js
Jest

## Tests

Jest was used to test the applications. All tests passed.
